Skillcraft Technology Internship Task :
Welcome to my internship task repository! This repository contains the task assigned during my internship as a Data science Intern at Skillcraft Technology. This task focuses on creating my skills in data visualization tools like Excel, power BI, etc. As a Data Science Intern at Skillcraft Technology, I’m working on real-world projects and building practical skills in data analysis.
Task 1:
Microsoft Excel is a widely used spreadsheet software developed by Microsoft and is known for its powerful data management, analysis, and visualization capabilities. It’s commonly used in fields like finance, data analysis, accounting, project management, and many others due to its versatility and ease of use.
The bar chart created the given task is to visualize the distribution of genders in a population.
Bar chart :
A bar chart is a type of data visualization that displays information using rectangular bars, where the length or height of each bar represents the value of the variable being measured. It’s a common and effective way to compare different categories or track changes over time.
Key Features of a Bar Chart:
1. Bars:
*Bars represent each category or group.
*The length or height of each bar corresponds to the value of the data it represents.
*Bars can be displayed vertically or horizontally.
2. Axes:
*X-Axis (horizontal): Typically represents categories or labels (e.g., gender, product type).
*Y-Axis (vertical): Represents the values associated with each category (e.g., counts, percentages, amounts).
3. Labels:
*Each bar can have labels for clarity, showing the exact value, category, or both.
*Axes labels provide context for each axis, making the data easier to interpret.
4. Spacing:
*Spaces between bars are typically included to help distinguish each category.
5. Color Coding:
*Colors can represent different groups or segments within the same chart (e.g., gender groups, regions).
6. Data Scaling:
*The axis scale is adjusted to ensure that bars fit well within the chart area, usually starting from zero to accurately represent the data.
7. Comparative Views:
*Bar charts allow easy comparison between different groups or categories.
8. Variants:
*Grouped Bar Chart: Used to show comparisons within multiple categories.
*Stacked Bar Chart: Used to show parts of a whole within each bar.
This task is ideal for exploring the basics of data analysis in Excel. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback about this repository. Connect with me on LinkedIn
